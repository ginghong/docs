Who we are and why we matter

Notes:

- Personal Indexes is a methodology. Use the term portfolio to communicate outcomes to users, use the term personal indexes to sell the methodology we are adopting. For example:
    
    Personal Indexes improve the long-term performance by x.
    
    Build portfolios that are driven by y.
    

## **1) Mission & Values**

### **Mission**

Help retail investors stay meaningfully exposed to crypto long-term without being consumed by it - turning chaos into calm, curated portfolios.

Crème exists to make crypto investing collaborative, structured, and personal.

### **Why we exist beyond making money**

We believe everyone deserves a calmer and smarter way to invest in crypto. Crème is built to bring structure, understanding, and composure to an industry defined by noise and volatility.

### **Change we want to create in the industry**

Move retail from speculative gambling to structured, long-term on-chain ownership - investing that is disciplined, personal, and accessible.

### **Core Values**

1. **Calm** – Trade anxiety for structure. Composed design and clear decisions.
2. **Curation** – Focus on narratives and intent over noise. Iterate and refine.
3. **Personalisation** – Portfolios shaped by intent, goals, and conviction.
4. **Collaborative Intelligence** – AI that reasons with you, not for you.
5. **Nostalgia** – Warm, tactile design that makes sophistication feel human.

### **Beliefs & Refrains**

- Consistency is an edge.
- Long-term vision beats short-term gains.
- Curation outperforms chaos.
- AI is a collaborative tool, not a black box that replaces human involvement.
- Stop chasing pumps. Start owning narratives.
- Stop trading on impulse. Start curating with purpose.

## **2) Positioning**

### **Positioning Statement**

For retail crypto investors seeking long-term, structured exposure without the chaos, Crème'ai is a collaborative AI platform for personal indexes - helping people reason with AI to cut through noise, build adaptive, narrative-driven portfolios, and stay positioned calmly for the long run.

Unlike bots, vaults, or chat-based agents that remove human judgement or chase hype, Crème brings structure and collaboration together for a simpler, more intentional investing experience.

### **Differentiators**

1. **Narrative-Driven Intelligence**
    
    Crème redefines investing around stories, not tickers. Our AI interprets the narratives shaping crypto markets and turns social, on-chain, and market data into investable structure.
    
2. **Collaborative AI**
    
    Investing reinforced as reasoning: users and AI co-create portfolios through intuitive workflows, not prompts or black boxes. Over time, Crème evolves into collective intelligence that compounds insight across the community.
    
3. **Adaptive Structure**
    
    Narrative and on-chain signals inform rebalancing and composition, keeping portfolios responsive and disciplined. Bridges ETF-style discipline with crypto’s composability.
    
4. **Personalisation**
    
    Every portfolio reflects an investor’s goals, risk appetite, and exclusions - structured yet personal. Crème turns passive exposure into intentional ownership by aligning strategy with individual conviction.
    
5. **Composability**
    
    Fully on-chain, self-custodial, and interoperable portfolios unlocking yield and exposure across ecosystems - from staked ETH to RWAs, LPs, and collectibles.
    

### **We Are Not**

- **Not built for institutions.** Designed for retail investors — simple, reflexive tools that adapt to each user’s needs.
- **Not a centralised bundle.** Unlike off-chain “buckets”, Crème gives direct on-chain ownership and yield.
- **Not a vault or fund.** Portfolios are composable and personal — never locked or pooled.
- **Not a trading bot.** We don’t automate speculation; we structure intent.
- **Not a chatbox AI.** We reject generic conversational agents in favour of guided, reasoning-based workflows.
- **Not a hype machine.** Crème stands for calm participation, not FOMO or emotion-driven engagement.

## **3) Narrative & Thesis**

### **Origin Story**

Crème was founded to solve a simple frustration: crypto investing is chaotic. Retail investors either juggle spreadsheets or chase hype. We saw the need for calm structure - a simpler way to invest with conviction for the long run.

### **Market Context**

Retail investors underperform traditional benchmarks by over 5 % yearly — a gap widened in crypto by volatility and information overload.

Existing solutions fall short:

- **Bundles** (e.g. Kraken) are centralised and off-chain.
- **Vaults** (Reserve, Enzyme) are rigid and institutional like.
- **Portfolio apps** (Glider) assume users already know what to buy.

### **Contrarian Stance on AI**

Most “AI agents” in crypto automate trades or replicate hype. Crème adapts a collaborative workflow architecture. It reasons with users, clarifies strategy, and structures long-term portfolios. We see AI as a transparent partner, not a black box.

### **Core Thesis**

As crypto matures, index-style portfolios will power mass retail ownership - offering long-term investors exposure without complexity or stress. Existing options miss the mark: centralised bundles lack on-chain composability, vaults are rigid and institutional, and portfolio apps still expect token-level decisions.

Crème reimagines this model with personal, narrative-driven portfolios that adapt to market trends. Through collaborative AI, investors reason with Crème to interpret narratives, clarify intent, and manage structured, self-custodial portfolios designed for calm, long-term ownership.
