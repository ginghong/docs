## Methodology

- **Invest in narratives, not noise**: We focus on the stories shaping crypto — and translate them into structure.
- **Reason with AI**: Our AI clarifies strategy with you; it doesn’t trade for you.
- **Process over impulse**: Rules-based drift control, periodic reviews, and composable on-chain execution.
- **Personal by default**: Your goals, risk appetite, and exclusions define your Pie.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Monitor">
  Track a few narratives that matter to you using curated signals (on-chain flows, liquidity, credible research).
</Step>

<Step title="Curate">
  Turn conviction into a Pie: choose assets, set weights, add exclusions and drift rules.
</Step>

<Step title="Manage">
  Use gentle rituals to stay aligned — rebalance only when drift triggers or narratives change.
</Step>
