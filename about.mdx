## Why we exist

We believe everyone deserves a calmer and smarter way to invest in crypto. Crème brings structure, understanding, and composure to an industry defined by noise and volatility.

## What we change

Move retail from speculative gambling to structured, long-term on-chain ownership — investing that is disciplined, personal, and accessible.

## Core values

- **Calm** – Trade anxiety for structure.
- **Curation** – Focus on narratives and intent over noise.
- **Personalisation** – Portfolios shaped by goals, risk, and conviction.
- **Collaborative Intelligence** – AI that reasons with you, not for you.
- **Nostalgia** – Warm, tactile design that makes sophistication feel human.
