## What is a Pie?

A Pie is a personal, narrative-driven index — a structured, on-chain portfolio aligned to your goals and convictions.

## How is this different from a trading bot?

Crème reinforces reasoning and structure. You set intent, rules, and reviews; we help you stay aligned. No hype-chasing automation.

## Is this a fund or vault?

No. Pies are self-custodial and composable. You own the assets; nothing is pooled.

## How often should I rebalance?

Use drift thresholds (e.g., ±5–10%) and a light review cadence (weekly scan, quarterly deep dive). Only act when rules trigger.

## Can I exclude assets or categories?

Yes. Exclusions are a first-class input when curating your Pie.

## Who is Crème for?

Crypto-native retail investors who want long-term exposure without micromanagement, plus newcomers learning through trusted creators.

## Is this financial advice?

No. Crème is an information and tooling platform. Always assess your own risk.
