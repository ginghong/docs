title: "Monitor narratives"
description: "Follow narratives with signal, not noise — social, on-chain, and market context."
---

## Goal

Stay informed without chasing hype. You’ll establish a light-weight ritual to monitor narratives.

## Inputs

- Curated feeds: social, on-chain, and market signals
- Narrative taxonomy and watchlist
- Time-boxed review cadence

<Steps>
<Step title="Pick narratives">
  Choose 3–5 narratives you care about (e.g., L2 scaling, ETH staking, RWAs).
</Step>

<Step title="Set signals">
  For each narrative, follow a minimal set of signals (on-chain flows, developer activity, liquidity shifts, and credible commentary).
</Step>

<Step title="Define cadence">
  Review weekly. Capture changes in conviction and note if actions are needed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Consistency is an edge. Tiny, regular reviews beat sporadic deep dives.
